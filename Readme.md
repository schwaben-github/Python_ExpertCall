### Mutable vs Immutable Objects in Python â€“ A Visual and Hands-On Guide

Python is an awesome language. Because of its simplicity, many people choose it as their first programming language.
Experienced programmers use Python all the time as well, thanks to its wide community, abundance of packages, and clear syntax.

But there's one issue that seems to confuse beginners as well as some experienced developers: Python objects. Specifically, the difference between mutable and immutable objects.

In this hands-on guide we will deepen our knowledge of Python objects, learn the difference between mutable and immutable objects, and see how we can use the interpreter to better understand how Python operates.

We will use important functions and keywords such as `id` and `is`, and we'll understand the difference between `x == y` and `x is y`.
